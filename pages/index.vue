          Simple Plan is a weekly/daily planning application that can aid in
          connecting a simple task to a blocked out event in a schedule. While
          using a digital calendar, it can be difficult to plan out habitual
          tasks. Planning these tasks in a planner can be tedious and the time
          planned can change day to day. Although, adding these tasks to a
          calendar does have value. Daily Planning can increase a personal
          commitment to the task and one gets to see their day planned out
          completely.
